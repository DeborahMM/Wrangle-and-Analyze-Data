# Wrangle-and-Analyze-Data
In this Udacity project, the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs will be wrangled and analyzed.
## Overview
The Twitter account rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog and typically a rating out of 10. WeRateDogs asks people to send photos of their dogs which are rated on a scale of one to ten, but are invariably given ratings that exceeds the maximum.
## Software
- Python (Numpy, Pandas, Requests, Tweepy, Json, Counter, re, time, datetime, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
## Steps
Data wrangling, which consists of:
- Gathering data
- Assessing data
- Cleaning data

Storing, analyzing, and visualizing our wrangled data
Reporting on 1) our data wrangling efforts and 2) our data analyses and visualizations

Of note, the dataset was not completely cleaned. The project requires that at least 8 quality issues and 2 tidiness issues be detected and documented.
